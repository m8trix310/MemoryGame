# MemoryGame
MonsterMash 

<!--Game coding was from an online tutorial on Javascript 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek.
Monster mash logo was created  with a free online generator
 https://cooltext.com/Logo-Design-Simple .
Images were downladed form a free png vector site  pngTree.com.
Extra styling was all me -->

# added generic timer that counts up. Not connected to code of the game
# added a refresh button to restart the game. 
# restyled the game from the original content and changed the theme. 
#things to add in the future
1 timer that is coded into the game
2 game over message
3 score for game
